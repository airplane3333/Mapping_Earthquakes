# Mapping Earthquakes
---
## Purpose
---
In this challenge, the objective was to map earthquakes from the USGS 
using Leaflet and Java script while using the MapBox API to plot earthquakes
using earthquake points from the USGS API and then plotting the earthquakes magnitude
to represent the size of the circle.  Also using Poly shapes to define the major fault 
lines on the map.  The images show that most major earthquake are near major fault lines

I used three different map layers and placed a legend on the map to highlight
the earthquakes strength on the Richter scale.
